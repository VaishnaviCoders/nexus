# Detail Product Description

shiksha Cloud is an integrated education management system that connects all functional areas of an institution under one platform. It automates repetitive processes like attendance entry, fee collection, and reporting to improve accuracy and efficiency.

Administrators can configure academic years, courses, sections, subjects, and staff roles directly from the dashboard. Teachers can mark attendance, update student details, and access relevant data. Students and parents can view attendance, payment status, and academic details through a secure login.

The system is built for scalability and can support multiple campuses or branches under a single organization. Data synchronization between modules ensures that all updates are reflected across the platform instantly.

Core modules include:
Academic setup and configuration
Student and staff management
Fee management and collection
Attendance management
Communication and notifications
Reporting and analytics

The database uses Prisma ORM with Supabase for secure data handling. The frontend is built using Next.js App Router with ShadCN UI components for a responsive and consistent user experience. All server actions are handled on the backend without exposing APIs unnecessarily, ensuring performance and data security.

The platform can be deployed on any modern cloud infrastructure with HTTPS and domain-level SSL support. It is optimized for SEO and can be integrated with a public-facing institutional website for direct access by stakeholders.
