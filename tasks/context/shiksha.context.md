## 6. HOW TO POSITION SHIKSHA.CLOUD

### When Talking to Principals

**Opening hook**: "Do you spend 3+ hours daily answering parent calls about fees and attendance?"

**Problem amplification**: "That's 15 hours a week—imagine if you could focus that time on improving education quality instead."

**Solution introduction**: "Shiksha.cloud automates all this. Parents check attendance on their phone, pay fees online, receive notices on WhatsApp. Your office workload drops 70%."

**Objection handling**: "But our teachers aren't tech-savvy..." → "If they use WhatsApp, they can use this. It's literally 2 taps to mark attendance. Schools with 50+ year-old teachers are using it comfortably."

**Closing**: "Let me show you in 10 minutes. I'll set up a demo school with your actual grades and sections. You'll see exactly how it works for YOUR school."

### Key Messaging Pillars

1. **TIME SAVINGS** → "Save 2.5 hours daily per teacher"
2. **SIMPLICITY** → "If you use WhatsApp, you can use this"
3. **AFFORDABILITY** → "₹79/student—cheaper than a burger"
4. **SPEED** → "Go live in 24 hours"
5. **TRANSPARENCY** → "Parents see everything, queries drop 80%"

## 8. OBJECTION HANDLING (REAL RESPONSES)

### "We can't afford software right now"

**Response**: "Let me show you the cost of NOT having it. You're probably losing 20+ staff hours weekly on manual work. At ₹500/hour minimum, that's ₹40,000/month in wasted time. Shiksha.cloud costs ₹15,800 for 200 students and saves MORE than 20 hours. You're actually LOSING money by not using it."

### "Our teachers won't adapt"

**Response**: "I understand that concern. But here's what happened at Delhi Public School Bangalore—their 55-year-old teacher Mrs. Sharma was most resistant. She's now our biggest fan because marking attendance went from 20 minutes to 2 minutes. She gets 18 extra minutes of teaching time daily. Teachers don't resist when something genuinely makes their life easier."

### "We need to think about it"

**Response**: "Absolutely, this is an important decision. Can I ask—what specific concerns do you need to think through? Is it the cost, implementation time, or something else? Let me address those directly so you have clarity."

### "We're happy with Excel/paper"

**Response**: "I appreciate that, and Excel works great for small data. But can you access student data from home? Can parents check attendance without calling you? Can you send emergency announcements to 500 parents in 2 minutes? These aren't luxuries anymore—parents expect this level of transparency now."

### "What if internet goes down?"

**Response**: "Teachers can mark attendance offline on their phone—it auto-syncs when connection returns. The system works on basic 3G/4G. Plus, critical data is cached locally. In 3 years of operation, no school has lost data due to connectivity."

**If No**: "Perfect. Can I show you a quick 10-minute demo of how [Similar School Name] reduced fee collection time by 3x? What's your email? I'll send you a meeting link."

**If Yes (competitor)**: "Great! Are you happy with it? [Listen]. Many schools switched to us because we're simpler and cost half the price. Worth a quick look?"

✅ Is the language claim accurate? (English only)
✅ Are the numbers real? (7 schools, 1,760 students, ₹8.4L fees)
